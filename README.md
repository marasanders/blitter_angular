Lab: Blitter

A modified version of Hannah Howard's "Blitter" exercise.
Are you ready to build the next hot Silicon-Valley Startup: Blitter?

If there's one VC space that is wide open for almost instant success, it's social networking. You pretty much build a social networking site of any kind, and Bam! you're worth a billion dollars.

So let's do this. Your job is to build an Angular site that pulls a list of "bleets" from an API and displays them in a list on a page. Your page should also have the ability to add new bleets, edit existing bleets and delete bleets. And, you should be able to click on a bleet and display a detail page for just that individual bleet. Along the way, you will need to use ui-router and ngResource.

API

Bleets will be accessible via a local Rails-based API. To get this up and running, follow the instructions below...

git clone https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/blitter-api
cd blitter-api
bundle install
rake db:create db:migrate db:seed
rails s
# open http://localhost:3000/bleets.json
Each bleet looks like this...

{
  "id":5,
  "content":"Is there a hack and tell meetup in DC?",
  "likes":2,
  "created_at":"2016-07-12T14:28:12.003Z",
  "updated_at":"2016-07-12T14:28:12.003Z"
}
To retrieve all bleets, you can send a GET request to http://localhost:3000/bleets. To get an individual bleet, just add an id to the end of the url, like so - http://localhost:3000/bleets/2.

Steps

1. Bootstrap an Angular application. It should have...

A master blitter module.
A bleets sub-module that handles all "Bleet" related functionality.
2. Include ui-router and use it to...

Create two routes. One for an index of bleets, the other for a show page.
Don't forget to add the directive required to view different states in your HTML.
ui-router documentation.
3. Create a factory that allows you to consume the Blitter API using ngResource and $resource.

$resource documentation.
4. Create a controller for each route.

The controller should have access to the functionality defined in your factory.
5. Create index.html and show.html bleet views.

index should list all bleets. show should offer a detailed view of each bleet.
In index, each bleet should have a link to its respective show page.
6. Add new functionality to your application. You can either...

Create a separate route, controller and view (with form) for new functionality. Or...
You can place the form on the index page and define form functionality in the index controller. No additional route required.
In either scenario, submission of the form should trigger a method in your controller that creates a new bleet in the API.
BONUS: If you go with the second index option, make it so that the new form only appears when you click a "New Grumble" button or link.
7. Add edit functionality to your application. You can either...

Create a separate route, controller and view (with form) for edit functionality. Or...
You can place the form on the show page and define form functionality in the show controller. No additional route required.
In either scenario, submission of the form should trigger a method in your controller that updates a bleet in the API.
BONUS: If you go with the second show option, make it so that the new form only appears when you click a "Edit Grumble" button or link.
8. Add a delete button or link next to each bleet in index.html.

When clicked, a controller method should be triggered that deletes the corresponding bleet in the API.
Bonuses

Add Like/Dislike Functionality

You'll notice that each post in the API has a likes value. Make it so that a user can like a bleet -- i.e., increment a bleet's likes by 1.

Each bleet's like value should be displayed on its index and show views.
"Liking" should be triggered by clicking a button, link or icon located next to the bleet on its index and show views.
Once you've done that, implement some "dislike" functionality.

Add Comments

The API also includes comments. A comment belongs to a bleet. A bleet's comments can be retrieving by accessing a URL like http://localhost:3000/bleets/2/comments. Each comment looks like this...

{
  "id": 1,
  "content": "Wait, what?!",
  "bleet_id": 1,
  "created_at": "2016-07-12T15:05:54.189Z",
  "updated_at": "2016-07-12T15:05:54.189Z"
}
A user should be able to comment on any bleet.

A bleet's comments should be visible on that bleet's show page.
A form to add a comment should exist on a bleet's show page.
Each comment should have an "Edit Comment" button or link next to it. When clicked, an edit form appears below the comment.
Each comment should have a "Delete Comment" button or link next to it. When clicked, the comment is (a) deleted from the database and (b) removed from the page.s
A comment DOES NOT needs its own show view.
